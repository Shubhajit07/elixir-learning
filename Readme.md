# Learning Elixir
Hello there, I am learning Elixir to create highly concurrent, fault tolerant systems. This repo is to track my learning progress and take notes.

As I'm just learning not building full fledged Elixir app, so I'll be writing all the codes in Elixir script (exs). I will explore Mix once I have a solid grasp of the core concepts.
